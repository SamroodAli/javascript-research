# Javascript research

These are exercises and experiments i have done while learning javascript.

## Serving an exercise folder

Some directories are Javascript exercises for the browser environment and not Nodejs. I created a simple cli to serve these directories.

1. Install all dependencies first

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the cli

```bash
npm run dev

```

1. Enter the directory number to run in the browser. You can
   go to http://localhost:3000 to access the directory
